### Greetings Fellow Sentients and Artificial Intelligences ðŸ‘‹

I'm an aspiring Full-Stack Developer!

Oh but you probably what to know something about me? Right then! 

Personally I'm somone that enjoys detail oriented work and anything that resembles a good puzzle. I have a background in management and team leadership (I know terribly boring right?) that I've aquired over the years from sales and retail customer facing enviroments. To keep those nifty abilities sharp over the years I have often used my personal time
to advance my leadership skills though weekly team building exercises involving problem solving,conflict resolution training, strategic goal planning and social bonding, all while encouraging skills in data figuring, team work, time management, and listening skills while in a diverse team setting. (That's all the far more exciting portion!)

In terms of programming, I'm comfortable with HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, GitHub, Node.js, WordPress, and responsive web design. I am familiar with Python, PHP, and MySQL. My skills are growing every day. (Especially once I figure out C+ so I can finagle with the Unreal Engine!)

Take a look at my portfolio, or you can also view my GitHub repositories for more projects I've worked on solo or in group settings!

Hope you enjoy your stay! Bye now! - ðŸ˜„
